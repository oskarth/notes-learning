# Notes on learning

My notes on learning. In particular through the lense of reaching
mastery.

Becoming a programming in 10 years. Learning by doing. Echoes
deliberate practice learnings, but in a less anal way.

It boils down to: code a lot, do things that challenge you.

There's not much more to it, seen from this lense. Remember: most
organic "problems" boil down to a few factors that determine the
outcome. 1 or 2, not much more, in the general case.

## M. Nielsen

mn poins out that there are two factors that determine
learning. I.e. necessary and probably sufficient conditions for
learning to takae place.

1. Desire.
2. Environment.

I largely agree with him. A lot of what is wrong with traditional
schooling is the "desire" part, and for someone taking an autodidact
approach, like me, it's the second part that is challenging.

What does this imply? Learn things which you want to learn, i.e. pull
rather than push, and get into the right environment. This is why
programs such as Hacker School are so successfully - they are
qualitatively different from your average CS education. It also
explains the "Florence paradox" very well.

This is something pg has written about. Most of the best work in a
field is done early one. This seems to be true for many things - see
Greek philosophers, Russian authors etc. Golden/Silver age of X.

* How general is this? Can we find some patterns through various
domains? How are they connected?
